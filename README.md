## Overview
This repository contains SQL queries written by me to practice data analysis
using a product-based dataset (Zepto).

The focus of this project is to solve real-world business questions related to
pricing, discounts, inventory, and categories using SQL.

All queries are self-written as part of my learning and practice.

## Objective
- Practice analytical SQL queries
- Analyze product pricing and discounts
- Work with inventory and category-level data
- Improve understanding of aggregation, filtering, and CASE logic
- Build an authentic SQL practice project

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains product-level information such as:
- Product name
- Category
- MRP
- Discount percentage
- Discounted selling price
- Quantity
- Weight in grams
- Stock status

(The dataset is used only for practice purposes.)

## SQL Concepts Used
- SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY
- TOP and DISTINCT
- Aggregate functions (SUM, AVG)
- GROUP BY
- CASE statements
- Arithmetic calculations
- Data filtering and sorting

## Business Questions Solved
- Identify top products based on discount percentage
- Find high-MRP products that are out of stock
- Calculate estimated revenue per category
- Filter products based on MRP and discount conditions
- Find categories with highest average discounts
- Calculate price per gram to identify best value products
- Classify products into Low, Medium, and Bulk based on weight
- Calculate total inventory weight per category

## How to Use
1. Load the dataset into a SQL table (Zepto)
2. Open the SQL file in SQL Server Management Studio
3. Run queries individually
4. Modify queries to explore more insights
